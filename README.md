# **Customer Query Optimization with Bayesian Learning**

## **Problem Statement**

When dealing with large customer databases, it is often impractical and economically infeasible to provide special treatment to every customer, such as offering a free trial of a product. However, we still need to identify the customers most likely to convert (e.g., purchase the product) to maximize the effectiveness of these special offers.

In this context, we only observe customer feedback and the binary conversion label (`0` or `1`) **after** providing them with the special offer. This creates a challenge:

**How can we strategically select which customers to query in order to maximize conversions while exploring a diverse range of customer profiles?**

## **Why Bayesian Optimization is Suitable for This Problem**

Bayesian Optimization (BO) is an ideal approach for this problem because our objective function, **customer score**, meets the typical characteristics of a "black-box function" in BO literature:

1. **No Analytical Expression**:  
   The customer score is based on feedback and conversion data, which cannot be expressed analytically. This is similar to optimizing the taste of a cookie based on its ingredients—there’s no clear formula, making BO a perfect fit.

2. **Smooth and Continuous**:  
   Small changes in customer features (e.g., age, location, or social media activity) are expected to result in small changes to the customer score. This smoothness allows BO to make informed decisions based on predictions from a surrogate model.

3. **Expensive to Evaluate**:  
   Each customer query involves offering a free trial and waiting for feedback, making it a costly operation. BO excels in minimizing the number of evaluations needed to find the best candidates.

4. **Noisy Observations**:  
   Feedback and conversions can be noisy due to factors like customer mood, external circumstances, or random variation. BO handles noisy observations well by incorporating Gaussian likelihoods into its probabilistic model.

By addressing these characteristics, BO allows us to efficiently navigate the trade-off between exploration (diverse customer profiles) and exploitation (high conversion potential).

## **Innovative Approach**

This project leverages **Bayesian Optimization** for customer selection, addressing the need for both **exploration** and **exploitation**:

- **Exploration**: Discover a wide variety of customer profiles to ensure our marketing strategy adapts to diverse demographics and behaviors.
- **Exploitation**: Focus on customers with a high potential of conversion, maximizing the effectiveness of special offers.

### **Core Algorithm: Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**

We achieve the balance between exploration and exploitation using the **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)** algorithm. This algorithm selects customers based on a combination of:

- **Mean**: The expected conversion potential (**customer score**).
- **Variance**: The uncertainty of the prediction, ensuring diverse exploration.

The **customer score** is derived from two components:
1. **Feedback**: Customer's response after using the free trial.
2. **Conversion Label**: Whether the customer ultimately purchased the product.

## **Dataset and Processing**

### **Dataset**

The AI agent works with a dataset containing:

- **Customer Features**: Attributes such as age, location, interaction information (e.g., social media activity), and other demographic/behavioral details.
- **Feedback and Conversion Status**: Observed **only after querying a customer** (offering a free trial).

### **Data Processing Workflow**

1. **Feature Conversion**: Converts raw customer attributes into numerical features suitable for modeling.
2. **Gaussian Process Regressor (GPR)**:
   - Initializes a GPR model to predict customer scores.
   - The model is trained based on available training data (if any).
3. **Iterative Customer Querying**:
   - The AI agent selects customers to query using the current GPR model and the UCB algorithm.
   - After querying, the agent observes feedback and conversion status and updates the GPR model.
   - This iterative process continues until the maximum number of queries is reached (e.g., a fixed budget for free trials).

## **Evaluation Metrics**

To evaluate the AI agent's performance, we measure its ability to select high-converting customers. Specifically, we calculate:

- **Hit Rate**: Among all customers who purchased the product (`conversion = 1`) in the test dataset, the percentage of those queried by the AI agent after exhausting the query budget (e.g., 400 queries in the example code).

This metric reflects the agent’s efficiency in identifying customers most likely to convert, balancing exploration and exploitation within the given constraints.

## **How This Approach Stands Out**

1. **Strategic Querying**: By combining Bayesian Optimization and Gaussian Process Regression, the approach strategically selects customers, avoiding random or arbitrary selections.
2. **Adaptability**: The model dynamically updates its predictions based on observed feedback, improving its understanding of customer behavior over time.
3. **Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off**: The UCB algorithm ensures that both high-potential customers and diverse profiles are considered, creating a balanced and effective marketing strategy.
